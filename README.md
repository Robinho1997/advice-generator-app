Here I created an Advice App which gives out random Advice onload or when the User clicks on a button.

TO make this work i used an API to fetch Data from it. 

If for some reason the API is not working and no Advice can be fetched , i programmed a fallback error message.

I really enjoy working with API'S. At first i thought this must be super complicated but thankfully it really isn't and more straightforward !
